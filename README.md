Participated in the research track of 2021 Terris Challenge, hosted by Superposition Fremont with the project. The project won the [Research Track Wolfram Award.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFEIJqwKNkX8MzAP17WceYxLJjWbZ-Ik/view?usp=sharing)

### Data_preparation.ipynb

Used the representation of speech data in waveform, which displays the change of amplitude over time. Explored how an accent influences the various features of waveform.


### Data_preparation.ipynb

Processing the audio data: We segmented the English speech data with Mandarin, Korean or Turkish accents into phonetic sequences and extracted various audio features from them.

### Model.ipynb

Building a model architecture: We tried to build a model that captures both both long term changes (words) and short term changes (frequency and wavelength of the word) in the speech data.
